    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "Ans: In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object, which contains information about the error, such as its type and context. Exceptions can be caused by various factors, including invalid input, file I/O errors, network errors, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language's syntax rules. These errors typically occur before the program is executed and prevent the program from running at all. Syntax errors are often caused by mistakes such as misspelled keywords, missing punctuation, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cause: Exceptions are caused by errors that occur during the execution of a program, such as invalid input or file I/O errors. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are caused by violations of the Python language syntax rules and occur before the program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Timing: Exceptions occur during runtime when the program is being executed. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully respond to errors and continue execution. Syntax errors must be fixed in the code before the program can be executed.\n",

    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it propagates up through the call stack until it reaches the top level of the program. If it still remains unhandled at this point, the program terminates abruptly, and Python prints a traceback, which includes information about the exception type, the line of code where it occurred, and the call stack leading up to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "# This function call will raise a ZeroDivisionError if 'b' is 0\n",
    "result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide()` function attempts to perform a division operation. However, if the second argument, 'b', is 0, it will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this exception is not handled in the code, the program will terminate abruptly, and Python will print a traceback similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 5, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide(10, 0)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide\n",

    "Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "    In Python, `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `try`: This statement is used to enclose the code block where an exception might occur.\n",
    "- `except`: This statement is used to catch and handle specific exceptions that occur within the `try` block.\n",
    "- `finally`: This statement is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, typically used for cleanup operations.\n",
    "- `else`: This statement is used to execute code if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example illustrating the usage of these statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / x\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division result:\", result)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"Execution complete.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `try` block attempts to execute the code inside it, which involves getting user input and performing division.\n",
    "- The `except` blocks catch specific exceptions (`ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError`) that might occur during the execution of the `try` block.\n",
    "- If no exceptions occur in the `try` block, the code inside the `else` block is executed.\n",
    "- The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, providing a way to perform cleanup operations.\n"

    "- The `validate_age()` function checks if the given age is valid.\n",
    "- If the age is negative or less than 18, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message.\n",
    "- The `raise` statement is used to explicitly raise exceptions.\n",
    "- In the `try` block, the `validate_age()` function is called with a negative age.\n",
    "- The `except` block catches the `ValueError` raised by the function and prints the error message."

    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exception classes that allow developers to create their own exception types tailored to specific error conditions in their applications. These exceptions inherit from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses, providing additional context and meaning to the errors encountered in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need custom exceptions for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Readability**: Custom exceptions provide descriptive names that convey the nature of the error, making code more readable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: Custom exceptions help organize code by encapsulating error-handling logic related to specific functionalities or modules, promoting modularity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Granular Error Handling**: Custom exceptions allow developers to differentiate between different error conditions and handle them appropriately, providing finer-grained control over error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: Custom exceptions make it easier to debug and troubleshoot code by providing meaningful error messages and stack traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example illustrating the creation and usage of a custom exception in Python:\n",

    "- The `withdraw()` function attempts to withdraw an amount from an account balance.\n",
    "- If the account balance is insufficient, the `withdraw()` function raises an `InsufficientFundsError` with details of the balance and the amount requested to withdraw.\n",
