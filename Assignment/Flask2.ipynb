    "Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "GET and POST are two different HTTP methods used in client-server communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GET: The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. It is a safe method, meaning it only retrieves data and does not modify it. GET requests can be cached and bookmarked. The request parameters in a GET method are sent as part of the URL. This means that the data sent by GET method can be seen in the browser's address bar, and hence it should not be used to send sensitive information like passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. POST: The POST method is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. The data sent to the server with the POST method is stored in the request body of the HTTP request. The POST method does not have any restrictions on data size to be sent and the data is not displayed in the URL. This method is considered less secure as the data sent is not encrypted, but it is more secure than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of how these methods can be used in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/data', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n",
    "def handle_data():\n",
    "    if request.method == 'GET':\n",
    "        # handle GET request, return data\n",
    "        return \"GET method\"\n",
    "    elif request.method == 'POST':\n",
    "        # handle POST request, process data and return result\n",
    "        return \"POST method\"\n",
    "In this example, the handle_data function will respond to both GET and POST requests at the URL /data. It uses the request.method attribute to determine what type of request was made, and handles it accordingly.\n"

    "Q2. Why is request used in Flask?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The request object in Flask is used to obtain data related to the client's request. It's a global object that Flask provides to represent the client's HTTP request. It contains data about the request, including the headers, the data sent in the body, the method used (GET, POST, etc.), and any URL parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the ways you can use the request object in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Form Data: If the client sends form data in a POST request, you can access this data using request.form.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Parameters: If the client sends query parameters in a GET request, you can access these parameters using request.args.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. JSON Data: If the client sends JSON data, you can access this data using request.json.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Headers: You can access the request headers using request.headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cookies: You can access any cookies sent by the client using request.cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Method: You can check the HTTP method used in the request using request.method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might use the request object in a Flask route:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request\n",

    "Q3. Why is redirect used in Flask?\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "The redirect() function in Flask is used to redirect the user from one endpoint to another. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as after a user has submitted a form and you want to redirect them to a new page, or if a user tries to access a page they don't have permission to see and you want to redirect them to a login page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The redirect() function returns a response object and accepts one required parameter: the URL to redirect to. This can be a relative URL (to redirect to another page within the same application) or an absolute URL (to redirect to a different website).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might use the redirect() function in a Flask route:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

    "def go_somewhere():\n",
    "    return redirect(url_for('home'))\n",

    "In this example, if a user navigates to /redirect, they will be immediately redirected to the home page (/). The url_for() function is used to generate the URL for the home function."

    "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render _template() function used?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Templates in Flask are a way to generate HTML dynamically. They are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document. Flask uses a templating engine called Jinja2 to render templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The render_template() function in Flask is used to generate output from a template file based on the Jinja2 engine that is found in the application's templates folder. This function takes the filename of the template as its first argument and any number of keyword arguments, each corresponding to a variable in the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we use render_template() is to separate the logic of your application from the presentation of your data. This is a fundamental concept in web development known as the separation of concerns, which makes your code cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might use the render_template() function in a Flask route:\n",

    "@app.route('/hello/<name>')\n",
    "def hello(name):\n",
    "    return render_template('hello.html', name=name)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if a user navigates to /hello/John, Flask will render the hello.html template, passing it the name variable with a value of 'John'. The hello.html template might look something like this: \n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>\n",
    "</body>\n",
