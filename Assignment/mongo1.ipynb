    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "What is MongoDB?\n",
    "MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. It is classified as a NoSQL database program because it uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, store data in a non-tabular form. This could be key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases, or document-based stores like MongoDB. They are highly flexible, as they allow for storing and processing of data in multiple formats, and they are typically easier to scale than relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios to use MongoDB over SQL databases\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large volumes of data: NoSQL databases like MongoDB can handle large volumes of data efficiently and are capable of horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "When schema flexibility is required: MongoDB doesn't require a fixed schema and allows you to store documents of different structures in the same collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with hierarchical data: MongoDB is a good choice when dealing with tree-like or graph-like structures, as it can store complex data structures like nested arrays and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "When high write loads are expected: MongoDB is designed to handle a high volume of read and write operations and offers features like sharding for horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "When rapid development is expected: The flexibility of MongoDB can be a big advantage in agile environments where the data requirements might change rapidly."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "1. Document-Oriented Storage: MongoDB uses BSON (Binary JSON) format for storing data. This provides a rich data model that can handle a variety of data types including arrays and nested documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ad Hoc Queries: MongoDB supports searching by field, range queries, and regular expression searches. You can query any field in the document, not just the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Indexing: Any field in a MongoDB document can be indexed. This includes indexing of inner documents and arrays. Indexing improves the performance of search operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Replication: MongoDB provides high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more copies of the data. Each replica set member may act in the role of primary or secondary replica at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Automatic Sharding: MongoDB uses sharding to scale horizontally by splitting data across multiple MongoDB instances. MongoDB automatically balances the data distribution, mitigating the need for manual data redistribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides an aggregation framework based on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated result.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. GridFS: For storing and retrieving large files such as images, video files, etc., MongoDB provides a specification called GridFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Flexible Schema: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for disparate documents to coexist in a single collection. This makes MongoDB particularly good at dealing with hierarchical data, arrays, and other complex structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Support for JavaScript: MongoDB supports JavaScript allowing the developer to use JavaScript to query and aggregate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Capped Collections: MongoDB supports fixed-size collections called capped collections. This type of collection maintains insertion order and, once the specified size has been reached, behaves like a circular queue."

    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect MongoDB to Python, you can use a library called pymongo. Here's an example of how to establish a connection, create a database, and a collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a connection\n",
    "client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)\n",

    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you first import the MongoClient from the pymongo module, then create a connection to the MongoDB server running on localhost at port 27017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you create a database called 'mydatabase'. In MongoDB, a database is not created until it gets content, so the database 'mydatabase' will not be created until data is inserted into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you create a collection called 'mycollection'. A collection in MongoDB is like a table in SQL databases. The collection 'mycollection' will not be created until data is inserted into it."

    "Q5. Explain how you can use the find) method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The find() method in MongoDB is used to select documents in a collection and return all that match the query. The find() method takes two optional parameters: a query object and a projection object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query object is used to filter the results. If this parameter is an empty object {}, the find() method returns all documents in the collection.\n",

    "    print(doc)\n",

    "Q6. Explain the sort) method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
