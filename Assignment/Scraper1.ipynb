    "Ans:\n",
    "websites where the data is extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database in table (tabular) format. It's used when the data you need to work with is available on a website, but not in a convenient format. Three areas where web scraping is used include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Price Comparison: Services such as ParseHub use web scraping to collect data from online shopping websites and use it to compare the prices of products.\n",
    "Social Media Scraping: Web scraping is used to collect data from social media websites such as Twitter to find trends.\n",
    "Email address gathering: Many companies that use email as a medium for marketing, use web scraping to collect email ID and then send bulk emails.\n",

    "02. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "Ans Different methods used for web scraping include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Human Copy-Paste: Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace human’s manual exploration and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.\n",
    "Text Pattern Matching: A very simple method that has been around for many years. It uses the Unix grep command or regular expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python).\n",
    "HTTP Programming: Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.\n",
    "HTML Parsing: This strategy is very effective for static websites - ones that send back HTML to your browser. When you load a webpage in your browser, you can inspect its source code, and see that it's just HTML.\n",
    "DOM Parsing: By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the Internet Explorer or the Mozilla browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts.\n",
    "Vertical Aggregation: There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of “bots” for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site.\n",
    "Semantic Annotation Recognizing: The pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing.\n",
    "Computer Vision Web-page Analysis: There are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might."

    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "Ans: Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and more readable manner."

    "Ans: Flask is used in this web scraping project as a web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It provides a lightweight and modular design that makes it easily adaptable to a variety of applications."
