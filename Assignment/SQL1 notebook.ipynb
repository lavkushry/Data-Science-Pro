    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Databases are designed to offer an efficient way to store, retrieve and manipulate data. They can handle anything from a small amount of data to large volumes of complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "SQL Databases (also known as relational databases) are table-based databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. They are based on a relational model where data is stored in rows and columns of different tables to minimize data redundancy. SQL databases are ideal for complex queries and are ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Examples include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases (also known as non-relational databases) are document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores. They do not have standard schema definitions that the data must adhere to. Scalability and flexibility for handling large data sets and high-speed queries are major advantages of NoSQL databases. They are not typically ACID compliant and are ideal for storing unstructured data. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and CouchDB.\n",

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL used to define and manage all the objects in an SQL database. DDL includes commands like CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: This command is used to create a new table or a new database.\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Age INT\n",

    "2. DROP: This command is used to delete an entire table or database.\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: This command is used to modify an existing database object, like a table. It can be used to add, delete/drop or modify columns in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD Email VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: This command is used to delete all the records from a table, but not the table itself. It's similar to the DELETE command with no WHERE clause, but is much faster because it doesn't generate individual row delete statements.\n",

    "SELECT: This command is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.\n",

    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column (or a combination of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. The primary key has the following characteristics:\n",

    "It must contain a unique value for each row of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column (or a combination of columns) in a table that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables. The foreign key in one table points to the primary key in another table. The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.\n",
