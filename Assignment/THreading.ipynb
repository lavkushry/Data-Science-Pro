    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Multithreading in Python is a way to make the program run multiple tasks concurrently. It's a form of multitasking where each task (also known as a thread) runs independently while sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used when you want to improve the efficiency of CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks. It's particularly useful in I/O-bound tasks where the program spends a lot of time waiting for input or output, such as downloading files from the internet or reading from a database. By using multithreading, you can start another task while waiting for the I/O operation to complete, thereby making better use of the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module in Python's standard library is used to handle threads. It provides a Thread class to create and manage threads, along with a variety of support for synchronization like locks, semaphores, and condition variables.\n",

    "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Responsiveness: If the process is divided into multiple threads, if one thread completes its execution, then its outcome can be immediately returned. This is especially beneficial in interactive and network programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource Sharing: Threads share the memory and the resources of the process to which they belong. The benefit of sharing code and data is that it allows an application to have several different threads of activity within the same address space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Economy: Allocating memory and resources for process creation is costly. Since threads share the same memory, they are economical to create and manage compared to processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Utilization of Multiprocessor Architectures: The benefits of multithreading can be greatly increased in multiprocessor architectures, where threads may be running in parallel on different processing cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Writing multithreaded code is more complex and challenging than writing single-threaded code. Issues such as synchronization and data consistency need to be carefully managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be difficult because it can lead to errors such as deadlocks, race conditions, and thread starvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overhead: Even though threads are lighter than processes, they still require the creation, scheduling, and termination of threads which can incur some overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Unpredictable Results: Due to the very nature of concurrent execution, a multithreaded program can give different results every time it's run, especially if the threads are not properly synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in Python: In Python, due to the GIL, even though multithreading can help with I/O-bound tasks, it doesn't provide much benefit for CPU-bound tasks because only one thread can execute at a time in a single Python process."

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "1. Deadlock: Deadlock is a situation in multithreading where two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. For example, if Thread A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2 which is held by Thread B, and Thread B is waiting for Resource 1, a deadlock occurs. Neither thread can proceed, creating a standstill. To prevent deadlocks, careful control and ordering of resource acquisition strategies are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Race Condition: A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. As a result, the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches of the processes. For example, if Thread A and Thread B are both reading and writing to a shared variable, the final value of the variable could depend on which thread writes to it last. To prevent race conditions, synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, or monitors are used to ensure that only one thread can access the shared data at a time."
