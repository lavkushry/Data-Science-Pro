    "# Q5. What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "Sure, here are some common functions to manipulate a Pandas DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "head(): This function returns the first n rows for the object based on position. It is useful to get a quick look at the data.\n",
    "Example: data_1.head()\n",
    "\n",
    "tail(): This function returns the last n rows for the object based on position. It is useful to check the end of the data.\n",
    "Example: data_1.tail()\n",
    "\n",
    "info(): This function shows the data types of each column and the number of non-null values. It is useful to get an overview of the data.\n",
    "Example: data_1.info()\n",
    "\n",
    "describe(): This function gives statistical information about the numerical columns in the DataFrame. It returns the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum.\n",
    "Example: data_1.describe()\n",
    "\n",
    "value_counts(): This function returns the frequency of each unique value in the Series. It is useful to get an idea of the distribution of categorical data.\n",
    "Example: data_1['State'].value_counts()\n",
    "\n",
    "drop_duplicates(): This function returns a DataFrame with duplicate rows removed. It is useful to remove redundant data.\n",
    "Example: data_1.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "groupby(): This function is used to group a DataFrame by one or more columns and perform some mathematical operation on it. It is useful to summarize data.\n",
    "Example: data_1.groupby(by='State').Salary.mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "merge(): This function is used to merge two DataFrames on a common column (field). It is useful to combine data from different sources.\n",
    "Example: data_1.merge(data_2, on='Name', how='left')\n",
    "\n",
    "memory_usage(): This function returns the memory usage of each column in bytes. It is useful to optimize memory usage.\n",
    "Example: data_1.memory_usage(deep=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "astype(): This function is used to convert the data type of a column in the DataFrame. It is useful to fix data type issues.\n",
    "Example: data_1['Gender'] = data_1.Gender.astype('category')\n",
    "\n",
    "loc[]: This function is used to access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array. It is useful to slice the DataFrame.\n",
    "Example: data_1.loc[0:4, ['Name', 'Age', 'State']]\n",
    "\n",
    "sort_values(): This function is used to sort a DataFrame by values in ascending or descending order. It is useful to arrange data in a specific order.\n",
    "Example: data_1.sort_values(by='Name', inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions are just a few examples of what you can do with a Pandas DataFrame. There are many more functions available to manipulate and analyze data in Pandas"
